CMake Warning (dev) at /home/jakobis/.local/share/JetBrains/Toolbox/apps/CLion/ch-0/222.3739.54/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.23/Modules/FindOpenGL.cmake:315 (message):
  Policy CMP0072 is not set: FindOpenGL prefers GLVND by default when
  available.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0072" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  FindOpenGL found both a legacy GL library:

    OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/libGL.so

  and GLVND libraries for OpenGL and GLX:

    OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/libOpenGL.so
    OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY: /usr/lib/libGLX.so

  OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE has not been set to "GLVND" or "LEGACY", so for
  compatibility with CMake 3.10 and below the legacy GL library will be used.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
